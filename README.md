# Iterative-vs-Recursive-Functions
The program is designed to create functions that calculate a factorial and series e in both recursion and iterations and then measure the time between both.

Q6: Based on your timing results, comment on the quote: “Would any of you very experienced programmers, if asked to code an iterative loop (like a mathematical series), think of using recursion or would that be a ‘mistake’ that a rookie programmer would leap to?”

A: Based on the timing results, the data shows us that a recursive approach is much slower than an iterative loop. Deitel states “recursion can be expensive in both processor time and memory space” (Deitel & Deitel 2013). As programmers we should aim to make our code as fast and responsive as possible for a seamless experience when a user runs a program. However, recursion may be a chosen approach when recursion more naturally mirrors a problem, and therefore results in an easier to understand program. So it may not be a “rookie mistake” in special instances, but and iterative approach in my view should always be considered first. (Deitel & Deitel 2013).
